# Next Steps for SOPS-TUI Development

This document outlines recommended next steps for enhancing the SOPS-TUI application.

## Core Features to Implement

1. **Enhanced File Operations**
   - Add support for batch operations on multiple files
   - Implement recursive directory encryption/decryption
   - Add file filtering by extension or pattern

2. **Key Management**
   - Implement age key rotation
   - Add support for multiple recipients management
   - Create key backup and recovery workflows

3. **Advanced SOPS Features**
   - Support for `.sops.yaml` configuration creation/editing
   - Add partial encryption support (encrypting only specific fields)
   - Support for different output formats (YAML, JSON, ENV, INI)

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Add a command palette for quick access to functions
   - Implement custom themes with configuration
   - Create a more comprehensive help system

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement background workers for long-running operations
   - Add caching for frequently accessed files
   - Optimize file browser for large directories

## Integration Opportunities

1. **Git Integration**
   - Add support for showing Git status of files
   - Implement automatic encryption before commit
   - Add history viewer for encrypted files

2. **Kubernetes Integration**
   - Add support for managing Kubernetes secrets
   - Implement automatic creation of YAML manifests
   - Add deployment preview before applying

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Create documentation for integrating with CI/CD workflows
   - Add templates for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
   - Implement environment-specific configuration

## Testing and Security

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Add unit tests for all core functions
   - Implement integration tests for user workflows
   - Create automated UI tests

2. **Security Auditing**
   - Conduct a thorough security review
   - Add memory safety validations
   - Implement input validation and sanitization

3. **Documentation**
   - Create user guides with examples
   - Document security best practices
   - Add API documentation for packages

## Code Organization

1. **Refactoring**
   - Improve error handling across the application
   - Standardize function signatures and return types
   - Extract common UI components for reuse

2. **Packaging**
   - Create installation packages for different platforms
   - Add Homebrew formula for macOS
   - Create Debian/RPM packages for Linux
   - Add Windows installer

## Community Building

1. **Open Source Contributions**
   - Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file
   - Add issue and PR templates
   - Set up a community forum or discussion space

2. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation site
   - Add examples for common workflows
   - Create video tutorials

By focusing on these areas, you'll transform SOPS-TUI into a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for managing encrypted secrets.
